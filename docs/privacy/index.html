                <p>
                    We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our service. Data protection
                    is of a particularly high priority for the management of the SnapDB. The use of the services
                    of SnapDB website is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject
                    wants to use special services via our website or app, processing of personal data could
                    become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory
                    basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address,
                    or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the
                    General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific
                    data protection regulations applicable to SnapDB. By means of this data protection declaration,
                    our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose
                    of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed,
                    by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the controller, SnapDB has implemented numerous technical and organizational
                    measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through
                    the SnapDB service(s). However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have
                    security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every
                    data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means,
                    e.g. by telephone.

                    Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a
                    so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie.
                    It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers
                    can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored.
                    This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser
                    of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A
                    specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.

                    By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be
                    optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned,
                    to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make
                    it easier for users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies,
                    e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because
                    this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system.
                    Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store
                    remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.

                    our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser
                    used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore,
                    already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or
                    other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers.
                    If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser
                    used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.
